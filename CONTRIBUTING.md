### Reporting Bugs

When creating a new bug report, please make sure to:

- Search for existing issues first. If you find a previous report of your issue, please update the existing issue with additional information instead of creating a new one.
- If you still decide to open an issue, please review the template and guidelines and include as much details as possible.

### Pull Requests

- **Code contributions are most welcome !**. For big changes or significant features, it's usually better to reach out first and discuss what you want to implement and how. This to make sure that what you want to implement is aligned with our goals for the project and that no one else is already working on it.
- Please update the documentation for new features or changes in functionality along with the code.
- Please follow existing code style. We use PEP8 for Python.
