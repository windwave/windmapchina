Logical view
============

The geographical visualization only works if we have all GPS coordinates: it isn't always the case.
Another way to visualize a network is to use a graph drawing algorithm to display the network.

The logical view relies on the :guilabel:`d3.js` JavaScript library to display the network in a visually pleasing fashion.
