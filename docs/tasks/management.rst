Task overview
-------------

In the :guilabel:`tasks/task_management` page, you can find a summary of all existing tasks.

From this table, you can:

- view the logs of the task.
- edit the task's properties, including the scheduling properties (dates and frequency).
- delete the task.

There are two additional options for periodic tasks (tasks that run periodically at a user-defined frequency):

- pause or resume the task
- compare the logs, between: 

    - two different devices.
    - two different scripts or workflows.
    - two different times.

Calendar

The :guilabel:`tasks/calendar` page provides an overview of all tasks, organized in calendar.
Clicking on a task opens a panel to edit its properties.
